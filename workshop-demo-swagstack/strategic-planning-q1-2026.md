## Executive Summary

Q1 2026 is a pivotal quarter for SwagStack. We're entering the year with strong momentum (68% YoY growth, €4.2M ARR) but facing critical decisions that will shape our trajectory:

1. **Series A**: Must close to fund growth—runway extends to August without it
2. **UK Market**: Prove unit economics or consider strategic retreat
3. **Enterprise Focus**: Our highest-margin segment needs attention after retention dip
4. **Platform Maturity**: Technical debt is constraining growth velocity

This document outlines the strategic context, key decisions, and recommended priorities for Q1 2026.

## Critical Decisions for Q1 2026

### Decision 1: UK Market - Double Down or Strategic Retreat?

**Context**: UK launched Q2 2025. Results are mixed—demand is strong (89% to target) but margins are unsustainable (22% vs 40% DACH).

**Options**:

| Option | Investment | Timeline | Risk |
|--------|-----------|----------|------|
| **A: Double Down** | €150K for new 3PL + marketing | 6 months to profitability | High - may not work |
| **B: Strategic Pause** | Maintain current, no growth investment | Indefinite | Medium - lose momentum |
| **C: Exit** | Wind down, focus on DACH | 3 months | Low - but lose €200K sunk cost |

**Recommendation**: Option A with strict milestones. If not at 30% margin by June, trigger Option C.

**Milestones**:
- Feb 28: New fulfillment partner signed
- Mar 31: UK gross margin >28%
- Jun 30: UK gross margin >35% or exit decision

---

### Decision 2: Series A Timing and Terms

**Context**: In active conversations with 4 VCs. Lead candidate is proposing €6M at €28M pre-money. We were targeting €8M at €35M.

**Options**:

| Option | Amount | Valuation | Dilution | Runway Added |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **A: Accept Current** | €6M | €28M pre | 17.6% | 24 months |
| **B: Counter-Negotiate** | €7M | €32M pre | 17.9% | 28 months |
| **C: Extend Seed** | €2M | €25M (bridge) | 7.4% | 10 months |
| **D: Bootstrap Path** | €0 | N/A | 0% | 8 months (current) |

**Recommendation**: Option B. Our metrics support higher valuation. Willing to accept €6.5M at €30M as floor.

**Timeline**:
- Dec 20: Final term sheet negotiations
- Jan 15: Term sheet signed
- Feb 28: Funds in bank

### Decision 3: Engineering Investment Split

**Context**: Engineering has capacity for 2 major initiatives in Q1. Competing priorities:

| Initiative | Effort | Revenue Impact | Strategic Value |
|------------|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Platform reliability (99.9%) | 8 weeks | Retention | High |
| Android app | 8 weeks | €30K MRR | Medium |
| SAP integration completion | 6 weeks | €80K ACV pipeline | High |
| Creator marketplace v2 | 10 weeks | €15K MRR | Medium |

**Recommendation**: Platform reliability + SAP integration. Android can be Q2, creator marketplace needs product strategy rethink first.

---

### Decision 4: Org Structure Changes

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **Create Customer Success Team**
   - Pull 2 people from Sales, hire 1 Enterprise CSM
   - Report to VP Sales initially, evaluate standalone in H2

2. **Split B2B Engineering Pod**
   - Current: 4 engineers doing enterprise + integrations
   - Proposed: 2 dedicated to integrations, 2 to enterprise features

3. **Marketing Leadership**
   - Lisa Andersson starting Jan 6
   - Give her budget authority for brand refresh immediately

**Investment Required**: 1 new hire (CSM), org restructure is reallocation

## Q1 2026 Strategic Priorities

Based on analysis above, recommended priorities in rank order:

### Priority 1: Close Series A (CEO)
*Why*: Everything else depends on runway. Without Series A, we're in survival mode by summer.

**Success Criteria**: €6.5M+ raised by Feb 28

### Priority 2: Fix Enterprise Retention (VP Sales)
*Why*: Enterprise is 52% of revenue with 70% margins. Losing accounts here hurts most.

**Success Criteria**: 95% Q1 retention, health scores implemented for all accounts

### Priority 3: UK Market Profitability (Head of Ops)
*Why*: Can't afford to bleed cash on expansion that doesn't work.

**Success Criteria**: New fulfillment partner, 28%+ gross margin by March

### Priority 4: Platform Reliability (CTO)
*Why*: Blocks enterprise sales, causing support load, brand risk.

**Success Criteria**: 99.9% uptime, <2s page loads

### Priority 5: Organic Growth Engine (VP Product + VP Marketing)
*Why*: CAC reduction critical for unit economics and Series A story.

**Success Criteria**: 40% increase in organic traffic, referral program launched
